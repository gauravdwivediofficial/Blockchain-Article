    <p>A <strong> blockchain</strong> is a type of <mark>Digital Ledger Technology (DLT)</mark> that consists of growing
        list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup>
        Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally
        represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the
        transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about the block
        previous to it, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block
        linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are
        recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

        <br><br>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public
        distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new
        transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible,
        blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine
        fault tolerance.<sup>[5]</sup>

        alt="Transaction Table">

    <p>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems
        Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."<sup>[11]</sup> Further work on a
        cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott
        Stornetta.<sup>[4][12]</sup> They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered
        with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its
        efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.<sup>[4][13]</sup> Under
        their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week
        since 1995.<sup>[14]</sup>

        <br><br>The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi
        Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp
        blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to
        stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.<sup>[4]</sup> The design was implemented the
        following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public
        ledger for all transactions on the network.<sup>[3]</sup>

        <br><br>In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have
        occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).<sup>[15]</sup> In January 2015, the size had grown to almost
        30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The
        ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.<sup>[16]</sup>

        <br><br>The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually
        popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.<sup>[17]</sup>

        <br><br>According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains
        attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters'
        phase.<sup>[18]</sup> Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative
        of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

        <br><br>In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their
        organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term "planning or [looking at] active experimentation with
        blockchain".<sup>[19]</sup> For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a
        'game-changer' for their business.<sup>[20]</sup>
    </p>

    <h2 id="structure"><small>Structure & Design</small></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called
        blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
        retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][21]</sup> This allows the participants
        to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[22]</sup> A blockchain
        database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are
        authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[23]</sup> Such a design
        facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a
        blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each
        unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has
        been described as a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[24]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when
        properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and
        acceptance.[citation needed]

        <br><br>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[25]</sup>
    <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation<sup>[26]</sup> and verification)</li>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications, if applicable)</li>
    </ul>

        alt="Blockchain formation.">
    </p>

    <h3 id="blocks">Blocks</h3>
    <p>Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.<sup>[3]</sup> Each
        block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks
        form a chain.<sup>[3]</sup> This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way
        back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).<sup>[27][28]</sup> To assure the
        integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.<sup>[29]</sup>

        <br><br>Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a
        secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the
        history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the
        chain are called orphan blocks.<sup>[28]</sup> Peers supporting the database have different versions of the
        history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a
        peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or
        overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee
        that any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to
        add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than
        overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases
        exponentially<sup>[30]</sup> as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very
        low.<sup>[3][31]</sup>:<sup> ch. 08 [32]</sup> For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain
        with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods
        that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is
        carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.<sup>[33]</sup>
    </p>

    <h4 id="blocktime">Block time</h4>
    <p>
        The <i>block time</i> is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the
        blockchain. Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.<sup>[34]</sup> By the time
        of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the
        transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set
        to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.<sup>[35]</sup>
    </p>
    <h4 id="hardforks">Hard forks</h4>
    <p><em>This section is an excerpt from Fork (blockchain) § Hard fork.</em></p>
    <p>A hard fork is a rule change such that the software validating according to the old rules will see the blocks
        produced according to the new rules as invalid. In case of a hard fork, all nodes meant to work in accordance
        with the new rules need to upgrade their software. If one group of nodes continues to use the old software while
        the other nodes use the new software, a permanent split can occur.

        <br><br>For example, <mark>Ethereum</mark> was hard-forked in 2016 to "make whole" the investors in The DAO,
        which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split
        creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that
        would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from
        a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after
        negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new
        software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.<sup>[36]</sup>

        <br><br>A more recent hard-fork example is of Bitcoin in 2017, which resulted in a split creating Bitcoin
        Cash.<sup>[37]</sup> The network split was mainly due to a disagreement in how to increase the transactions per
        second to accommodate for demand.<sup>[38]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3 id="decentralization">Decentralization</h3>
    <p>By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data
        being held centrally.<sup>[3]</sup> The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed
        networking. One risk of a lack of decentralization is a so-called "51% attack" where a central entity can gain
        control of more than half of a network and can manipulate that specific blockchain record at will, allowing
        double-spending.<sup>[39]</sup>

        <br><br>Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that computer crackers can
        exploit; likewise, they have no central point of failure. Blockchain security methods include the use of
        public-key cryptography.<sup>[40]: 5 </sup> A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an
        address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A
        private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise
        interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally
        considered incorruptible.<sup>[3]</sup>

        <br><br>Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive
        database replication<sup>[41]</sup> and computational trust. No centralized "official" copy exists and no user
        is "trusted" more than any other.<sup>[40]</sup> Transactions are broadcast to the network using the software.
        Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis. Early blockchains rely on energy-intensive mining nodes to
        validate transactions,<sup>[28]</sup> add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed
        block to other nodes.<sup>[31]: ch. 08 </sup> Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as
        proof-of-work, to serialize changes.<sup>[42]</sup> Later consensus methods include proof of
        stake.<sup>[28]</sup> The growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization
        because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.<sup>[43]</sup>
    </p>


    <h3 id="openness">Openness</h3>
    <p>Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public,
        still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen
        over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers
        tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a
        blockchain.<sup>[44][45][46][47][48]</sup> Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term
        "blockchain" may be applied to any <b>data structure</b> that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These
        blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in
        databases.<sup>[49]</sup> Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in
        a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a
        blockchain.<sup>[50]: 30–31 </sup> Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate
        databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against
        operator tampering and revision.<sup>[44][46]</sup> Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that "many in-house
        blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model,
        proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."<sup>[9][51]</sup></p>


    <h4 id="permissionless(public)blockchain">Permissionless (public) blockchain</h4>
    <p>An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not
        required and no access control is needed.<sup>[30]</sup> This means that applications can be added to the
        network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.<sup>[30]</sup>

        <br><br>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include
        proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by
        Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992
        paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

        <br><br>In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but
        increasing in China.<sup>[52]</sup> Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of
        April 2018, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.
    </p>


    <h4 id="permissionless(private)blockchain">Permissioned (private) blockchain</h4>
    <p><em>See also: Distributed ledger</em></p>
    <p>Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.<sup>[53]</sup> In
        contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network
        owner. They do not rely on anonymous nodes to validate transactions nor do they benefit from the network
        effect.<sup>[54]</sup> Permissioned blockchains can also go by the name of 'consortium'
        blockchains.<sup>[55]</sup> It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of
        decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized
        in practice.<sup>[10]</sup></p>


    <h4 id="disadvantagesofpermissionedblockchain">Disadvantages of permissioned blockchain</h4>
    <p>Nikolai Hampton pointed out in Computerworld that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private
        blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation
        resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could
        effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."<sup>[9]</sup> This
        has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the
        financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the
        expense of others,<sup>[56]</sup> and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort.
        It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's
        time-consuming and expensive."<sup>[9]</sup> He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race';
        there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house
        blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases."<sup>[9]</sup></p>


    <h4 id="blockchainanalysis">Blockchain analysis</h4>
    <p>The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum,
        litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.<sup>[57]</sup> A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants
        access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how. The process of understanding and
        accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and
        banks.<sup>[58][59]</sup> The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies enabling
        illicit dark market trade of drugs, weapons, money laundering, etc.<sup>[60]</sup> A common belief has been that
        cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is
        changing and now specialised tech companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges,
        law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto exchanges. The
        development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise the use of new cryptos such as
        Monero.<sup>[61][62][63]</sup> The question is about the public accessibility of blockchain data and the
        personal privacy of the very same data. It is a key debate in cryptocurrency and ultimately in the
        blockchain.<sup>[64]</sup></p>
    <h3 id="standardisation">Standardisation</h3>
    <p>In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the International Organization for Standardization to
        consider developing standards to support blockchain technology. This proposal resulted in the creation of ISO
        Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.<sup>[65]</sup> The technical committee
        has working groups relating to blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy, identity,
        smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain and DLT, as well as standards specific to
        industry sectors and generic government requirements.<sup>[66][non-primary source needed]</sup> More than 50
        countries are participating in the standardization process together with external liaisons such as the Society
        for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International
        Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Economic
        Commission for Europe (UNECE).<sup>[66]</sup>

        <br><br>Many other national standards bodies and open standards bodies are also working on blockchain
        standards.<sup>[67]</sup> These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology<sup>[68]</sup>
        (NIST), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization<sup>[69]</sup> (CENELEC), the Institute of
        Electrical and Electronics Engineers<sup>[70]</sup> (IEEE), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured
        Information Standards (OASIS), and some individual participants in the Internet Engineering Task
        Force<sup>[71]</sup> (IETF).

    <h3 id="centralizedblockchain">Centralized Blockchain</h3>
    <p>Although most of blockchain implementation are decentralized and distributed, Oracle launched a centralized
        blockchain table feature in Oracle 21c database. The Blockchain Table in Oracle 21c database is a centralized
        blockchain which provide immutable feature. Compared to decentralized blockchains, centralized blockchains
        normally can provide a higher throughput and lower latency of transactions than consensus-based distributed
        blockchains.<sup>[72][73]</sup></p>
    <h2 id="types">Types</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains,
        consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.</p>
    <h3 id="publicblockchains">Public blockchains</h3>
    <p>A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send
        transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus
        protocol).<sup>[74][self-published source?]</sup> Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who
        secure them and utilize some type of a Proof of Stake or Proof of Work algorithm.

        <br><br>Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum
        blockchain.
    </p>
    <h3 id="privateblockchains">Private blockchains</h3>
    <p>A private blockchain is permissioned.<sup>[53]</sup> One cannot join it unless invited by the network
        administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted. To distinguish between open blockchains and
        other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the
        terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.</p>
    <h3 id="hybridblockchains">Hybrid blockchains</h3>
    <p>A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.<sup>[75]</sup> The exact
        workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization and decentralization are used.</p>
    <h3 id="sidechains">Sidechains</h3>
    <p>A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary
        blockchain.<sup>[76][77]</sup> Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent
        digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate
        independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate
        consensus algorithm, etc.).<sup>[78][better source needed]</sup></p>


    <h2 id="uses">Uses</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed
        ledger for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products that had matured
        from proof of concept by late 2016.<sup>[52]</sup> As of 2016, some businesses have been testing the technology
        and conducting low-level implementation to gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back
        office.<sup>[79]</sup>

        <br><br>In 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were invested in blockchain technology, which
        represents an 89% increase from the year prior. Additionally, the International Data Corp has estimated that
        corporate investment into blockchain technology will reach $12.4 billion by 2022.<sup>[80]</sup> Furthermore,
        According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world,
        blockchain technology has the potential to generate an annual business value of more than $3 trillion by 2030.
        PwC's estimate is further augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed 600 business
        executives and determined that 84% have at least some exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which indicts
        a significant demand and interest in blockchain technology.<sup>[81]</sup>

        <br><br>Individual use of blockchain technology has also greatly increased since 2016. According to statistics
        in 2020, there were more than 40 million blockchain wallets in 2020 in comparison to around 10 million
        blockchain wallets in 2016.<sup>[82]</sup>

    <h3 id="cryptocurrencies">Cryptocurrencies</h3>
    <em>Main article: Cryptocurrency</em>
    <p>Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the bitcoin network and
        Ethereum network are both based on blockchain. On 8 May 2018 Facebook confirmed that it would open a new
        blockchain group[84] which would be headed by David Marcus, who previously was in charge of Messenger.
        Facebook's planned cryptocurrency platform, Libra (now known as Diem), was formally announced on June 18,
        2019.<sup>[85][86]</sup>

        <br><br>The criminal enterprise Silk Road, which operated on Tor, utilized cryptocurrency for payments, some of
        which the US federal government has seized through research on the blockchain and forfeiture.<sup>[87]</sup>

        <br><br>Governments have mixed policies on the legality of their citizens or banks owning cryptocurrencies.
        China implements blockchain technology in several industries including a national digital currency which
        launched in 2020.<sup>[88]</sup> To strengthen their respective currencies, Western governments including the
        European Union and the United States have initiated similar projects.<sup>[89]</sup>
    </p>



    <h3 id="smartcontracts">Smart contracts</h3>
    <em>Main article: Smart contract</em>
    <p>Blockchain-based smart contracts are proposed contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced
        without human interaction.<sup>[90]</sup> One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. A
        key feature of smart contracts is that they do not need a trusted third party (such as a trustee) to act as an
        intermediary between contracting entities — the blockchain network executes the contract on its own. This may
        reduce friction between entities when transferring value and could subsequently open the door to a higher level
        of transaction automation.<sup>[91]</sup> An IMF staff discussion from 2018 reported that smart contracts based
        on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general. But "no viable
        smart contract systems have yet emerged." Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status was
        unclear.<sup>[92][93]</sup></p>


    <h3 id="financialservices">Financial services</h3>
    <p>According to Reason, many banks have expressed interest in implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking
        and are cooperating with companies creating private blockchains,<sup>[94][95][96]</sup> and according to a
        September 2016 IBM study, this is occurring faster than expected.<sup>[97]</sup>

        <br><br>Banks are interested in this technology not least because it has the potential to speed up back office
        settlement systems.<sup>[98]</sup> Moreover, as the blockchain industry has reached early maturity institutional
        appreciation has grown that it is, practically speaking, the infrastructure of a whole new financial industry,
        with all the implications which that entails.<sup>[99]</sup>

        <br><br>Banks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore
        how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.<sup>[100][101]</sup>

        <br><br>Berenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an "overhyped technology" that has had a large
        number of "proofs of concept", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.<sup>[102]</sup>

        <br><br>The blockchain has also given rise to initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as a new category of digital
        asset called security token offerings (STOs), also sometimes referred to as digital security offerings
        (DSOs).<sup>[103]</sup> STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on public, regulated stock exchange and are used
        to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual
        property, real estate,<sup>[104]</sup> art, or individual products. A number of companies are active in this
        space providing services for compliant tokenization, private STOs, and public STOs.

    <h3 id="games">Games</h3>
    <em>Main article: Blockchain game</em>
    <p>Blockchain technology, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has been used in video games for
        monetization. Many live-service games offer in-game customization options, such as character skins or other
        in-game items, which the players can earn and trade with other players using in-game currency. Some games also
        allow for trading of virtual items using real-world currency, but this may be illegal in some countries where
        video games are seen as akin to gambling, and has led to gray market issues such as skin gambling, and thus
        publishers typically have shied away from allowing players to earn real-world funds from games.<sup>[105]</sup>
        Blockchain games typically allow players to trade these in-game items for cryptocurrency, which can then be
        exchanged for money.<sup>[106]</sup>

        <br><br>The first known game to use blockchain technologies was CryptoKitties, launched in November 2017, where
        the player would purchase NFTs with Ethereum cryptocurrency, each NFT consisting of a virtual pet that the
        player could breed with others to create offspring with combined traits as new NFTs.<sup>[107][106]</sup> The
        game made headlines in December 2017 when one virtual pet sold for more than US$100,000.<sup>[108]</sup>
        CryptoKitties also illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion
        on the Ethereum network in early 2018 with approximately 30% of all Ethereum transactions[clarification needed]
        being for the game.<sup>[109][110]</sup>

        <br><br>By the early 2020s, there had not been a breakout success in video games using blockchain, as these
        games tend to focus on using blockchain for speculation instead of more traditional forms of gameplay, which
        offers limited appeal to most players. Such games also represent a high risk to investors as their revenues can
        be difficult to predict.<sup>[106]</sup> However, limited successes of some games, such as Axie Infinity during
        the COVID-19 pandemic, and corporate plans towards metaverse content, refueled interest in the area of GameFi, a
        term describing the intersection of video games and financing typically backed by blockchain currency, in the
        second half of 2021.<sup>[111]</sup> Several major publishers, including Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, and Take Two
        Interactive, have stated that blockchain and NFT-based games are under serious consideration for their companies
        in the future.<sup>[112]</sup>

        <br><br>In October 2021, Valve Corporation banned blockchain games, including those using cryptocurrency and
        NFTs, from being hosted on its Steam digital storefront service, which is widely used for personal computer
        gaming, claiming that this was an extension of their policy banning games that offered in-game items with
        real-world value. Valve's prior history with gambling, specifically skin gambling, was speculated to be a factor
        in the decision to ban blockchain games.<sup>[113]</sup> Journalists and players responded positively to Valve's
        decision as blockchain and NFT games have a reputation for scams and fraud among most PC gamers,[105][113] Epic
        Games, which runs the Epic Games Store in competition to Steam, said that they would be open to accepted
        blockchain games, in the wake of Valve's refusal.<sup>[114]

    <h3 id="supplychain">Supply chain</h3>
    <p>There have been several different efforts to employ blockchains in supply chain management.</p>
    <li>Shipping industry — incumbent shipping companies and startups have begun to leverage blockchain technology to
        facilitate the emergence of a blockchain-based platform ecosystem that would create value across the global
        shipping supply chains.<sup>[115]</sup></li>
    <li><b>Precious commodities mining</b> — Blockchain technology has been used for tracking the origins of gemstones
        and other precious commodities. In 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported that the blockchain technology company
        Everledger was partnering with IBM's blockchain-based tracking service to trace the origin of diamonds to ensure
        that they were ethically mined.<sup>[116]</sup> As of 2019, the Diamond Trading Company (DTC) has been involved
        in building a diamond trading supply chain product called Tracr.<sup>[117]</sup></li>
    <li><b>Food supply</b> — As of 2018, Walmart and IBM were running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for
        supply chain monitoring for lettuce and spinach — all nodes of the blockchain were administered by Walmart and
        were located on the IBM cloud.<sup>[118]</sup></li>
    <li>Fashion industry — There is an opaque relationship between brands, distributors, and customers in the fashion
        industry, which will prevent the sustainable and stable development of the fashion industry. Blockchain makes up
        for this shortcoming and makes information transparent, solving the difficulty of sustainable development of the
        industry.<sup>[119]</sup></li>

    <h3 id="domainnames">Domain names</h3>
    <p>There are several different efforts to offer domain name services via the blockchain. These domain names can be
        controlled by the use of a private key, which purports to allow for uncensorable websites. This would also
        bypass a registrar's ability to suppress domains used for fraud, abuse, or illegal content.<sup>[120]</sup>

        <br><br>Namecoin is a cryptocurrency that supports the ".bit" top-level domain (TLD). Namecoin was forked from
        bitcoin in 2011. The .bit TLD is not sanctioned by ICANN, instead requiring an alternative DNS
        root.<sup>[120]</sup> As of 2015, it was used by 28 websites, out of 120,000 registered names.<sup>[121]</sup>
        Namecoin was dropped by OpenNIC in 2019, due to malware and potential other legal issues.<sup>[122]</sup> Other
        blockchain alternatives to ICANN include The Handshake Network,<sup>[121]</sup> EmerDNS, and Unstoppable
        Domains.<sup>[120]</sup>

        <br><br>Specific TLDs include ".eth", ".luxe", and ".kred", which are associated with the Ethereum blockchain
        through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). The .kred TLD also acts as an alternative to conventional
        cryptocurrency wallet addresses, as a convenience for transferring cryptocurrency.<sup>[123]</sup>
    </p>


    <h3 id="otheruses">Other uses</h3>
    <p>Blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on
        sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users<sup>[124]</sup> or
        musicians.<sup>[125]</sup> The Gartner 2019 CIO Survey reported 2% of higher education respondents had launched
        blockchain projects and another 18% were planning academic projects in the next 24 months.<sup>[126]</sup> In
        2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music
        distribution.<sup>[127]</sup> Imogen Heap's Mycelia service has also been proposed as a blockchain-based
        alternative "that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and
        other musicians."<sup>[128][129]</sup>

        <br><br>New distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance,
        parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain.<sup>[130][131]</sup> The sharing
        economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating
        peers.<sup>[132]</sup> The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S. Institute
        of Museum and Library Services.<sup>[133]</sup>

        <br><br>Other blockchain designs include Hyperledger, a collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to
        support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow
        (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM).<sup>[134][135][136]</sup> Another is Quorum, a
        permissionable private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage, used for contract
        applications.<sup>[137]</sup>

        <br><br>Oracle introduced a blockchain table feature in its Oracle 21c database.<sup>[72][73]</sup>

        <br><br>Blockchain is also being used in peer-to-peer energy trading.<sup>[138][139][140]</sup>

        <br><br>Blockchain could be used in detecting counterfeits by associating unique identifiers to products,
        documents and shipments, and storing records associated with transactions that cannot be forged or
        altered.<sup>[141][142]</sup> It is however argued that blockchain technology needs to be supplemented with
        technologies that provide a strong binding between physical objects and blockchain systems.<sup>[143]</sup> The
        EUIPO established an Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum, with the objective of "defining, piloting and
        implementing" an anti-counterfeiting infrastructure at the European level.<sup>[144][145]</sup> The Dutch
        Standardisation organisation NEN uses blockchain together with QR Codes to authenticate
        certificates.<sup>[146]</sup>

        <br><br>2022 Jan 30 Beijing and Shanghai are among the cities designated by China to trial blockchain
        applications.<sup>[147]</sup>
    </p>


    <h2 id="blockchaininteroperability">Blockchain interoperability</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>With the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies,
        blockchain interoperability is becoming a topic of major importance. The objective is to support transferring
        assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system. Wegner<sup>[148]</sup> stated that
        "interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in
        language, interface, and execution platform". The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to
        support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.

        <br><br>There are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available.<sup>[149]</sup> They can be
        classified into three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain
        connectors.

        <br><br>Several individual IETF participants produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability
        architecture.<sup>[150]</sup>
    </p>


    <h2 id="energyconsumptionconcerns">Energy consumption concerns</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Some cryptocurrencies use blockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are
        validated and verified. This requires a large amount of energy. In June 2018 the Bank for International
        Settlements criticized the use of public proof-of-work blockchains for their high energy
        consumption.<sup>[151][152][153]</sup>

        <br><br>Early concern over the high energy consumption was a factor in later blockchains such as Cardano (2017),
        Solana (2020) and Polkadot (2020) adopting the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake model. Researchers have
        estimated that Bitcoin consumes 100,000 times as much energy as proof-of-stake networks.<sup>[154][155]</sup>

        <br><br>In 2021, a study by Cambridge University determined that Bitcoin (at 121 terawatt-hours per year) used
        more electricity than Argentina (at 121TWh) and the Netherlands (109TWh).<sup>[156]</sup></sup> According to
        Digiconomist, one bitcoin transaction required 708 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy, the amount an average
        U.S. household consumed in 24 days.<sup>[157]</sup>

        <br><br>In February 2021, U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen called Bitcoin "an extremely inefficient way to
        conduct transactions", saying "the amount of energy consumed in processing those transactions is
        staggering".<sup>[158]</sup> In March 2021, Bill Gates stated that "Bitcoin uses more electricity per
        transaction than any other method known to mankind", adding "It's not a great climate thing."<sup>[159]</sup>

        <br><br>Nicholas Weaver, of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California,
        Berkeley, examined blockchain's online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains,
        and in both cases found it grossly inadequate.<sup>[160][161]</sup> The 31TWh-45TWh of electricity used for
        bitcoin in 2018 produced 17-23 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.<sup>[162][163]</sup> By 2022, the University of
        Cambridge and Digiconomist estimated that the two largest proof-of-work blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum,
        together used twice as much electricity in one year as the whole of Sweden, leading to the release of up to 120
        million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> each year.<sup>[164]</sup>

        <br><br>Some cryptocurrency developers are considering moving from the proof-of-work model to the proof-of-stake
        model.<sup>[165]</sup>
